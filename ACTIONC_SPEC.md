## 1. Language Overview

### 1.1 What is ActionC?

ActionC is an esoteric programming language that extends ArnoldC by incorporating iconic one-liners from 80s and 90s action movies. While ArnoldC uses only Arnold Schwarzenegger quotes, ActionC expands the vocabulary to include quotes from Die Hard, Lethal Weapon, Robocop, Aliens, The Matrix, and many more classic action films.

ActionC compiles to Java bytecode and runs on the JVM.

### 1.2 Design Philosophy

- **Every keyword is an action movie quote** — Programming should feel like writing a screenplay
- **Quotes match their programming purpose** — `IT'S JUST BEEN REVOKED` for "not equal" (revoking equality!)
- **Backwards compatible with ArnoldC** — All valid ArnoldC programs are valid ActionC programs
- **Practical improvements** — Adds arrays, floats, strings, error handling, and more

### 1.3 Hello World

    TALK TO THE HAND "HELLO BOYS I'M BACK"
YOU HAVE BEEN TERMINATED
